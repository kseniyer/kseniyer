- 👋 Hi, I’m @kseniyer
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new information and improving my skills. 
I am an educator by first education, but I am fascinated by coding and I want to understand the front-end and move to IT. 
I am conscious of having a long way to go, but I'm one of those who are not afraid of difficulties and are ready to go for their dreams, no matter what. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a permanent basis.
- 📫 How to reach me: telegram @ksenia_yershova
